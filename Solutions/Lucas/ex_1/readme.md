# Aws s3 and sqs test project

This is a project that I did to practice aws sqs and s3 

## Folder structure

- **env.py**: set env variables to this file.
- **requirements.txt**: add application dependencies here.
- **localstack_setup.sh**: use this file to setup your localstack with the necessary aws services for local testing.
- **gunicorn_starter.sh**: this file has the command to start gunicorn; modify this file to change gunicorn starting settings.
- **app.py**: Entrypoint for the application; all the routes are defined here; add news routes here.
- **/src**: this folder has the source folder for the application; add necessary modules for the application here.
- **/handler**: this folder has the handlers of the routes in the app.py. Each route should have a handler file here responsible for handling requests. 

## How to run the application
